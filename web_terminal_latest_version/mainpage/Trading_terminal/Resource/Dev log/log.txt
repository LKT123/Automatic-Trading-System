Structural Plan:

1. Json File to store the settings                       # Need actions

2. Data folder to store the historial data for testing   # Change to runtime calculation and need elaboration

3. terminal.py for flow control                          # flow control handled to logic.py

4. basic analysis for analysis folder                    # skdj, MACD and MA

5. A separated py file to control the analysis (unsure)  # Implemented, see logic.py

6. Analysis on different time intervals                  # Need actions

7. Logging program that records test results             # Need actions

8. Model for ML (future dev)                             # Preliminary verification combined with class project
